# Claude Code / Anthropic Project Structure Research & Synthesis — Perplexity AI Prompt

## Mission Directive

You are tasked with delivering a comprehensive analysis and actionable best-practice template for **local project folder structures** in Claude Code, Anthropic, prompt engineering, LLM, or advanced AI workflow projects. The output must be directly useful for practitioners wishing to set up robust, maintainable, and automation-ready project environments for Claude/Anthropic-based workflows.

---

## Research Plan

**1. Repository & Source Identification**
   - Identify and analyze public GitHub repositories with well-documented, modular project structures for Claude Code, Anthropic, or general prompt-engineering/LLM workflows.
   - Prioritize sources including:
     - Anthropic official blogs/guides
     - Popular Claude Code best-practices repositories
     - Community articles (e.g., AIXplore, AIBase) summarizing real-world usage and structure

**2. Pattern Extraction**
   - Extract and enumerate common folder and file patterns:
     - Root-level documentation
     - Directories for source code, prompts, logs, configs, scripts, automations
     - Project automation and workflow integration (.github/workflows, scripts)
     - Session/task isolation methods (worktrees, branches, subfolders)
     - Optional: Polyglot/multi-language structure adaptations

**3. Synthesis**
   - Synthesize findings into a concise set of best practices, with rationale for each major pattern.
   - Highlight operational, maintainability, and scaling benefits or tradeoffs.
   - Note any gaps or unresolved questions in the literature or public repos.

**4. Actionable Template & Recommendations**
   - Deliver a clear, actionable project structure template (tree diagram + folder/file explanations).
   - Specify how to adapt for different project types (single-language, polyglot, research, production).
   - Provide practical recommendations for documentation, session management, and automation.
   - List primary sources with direct links for further reference.

## Output Requirements

- **Comprehensive analytic report** (well-structured, with headings and bullet points)
- **Folder structure template** (tree diagram, annotated)
- **Actionable recommendations** for practitioners
- **Source/reference list** (with links)
- **No profile/role-centric deep segregation** unless justified by a clear source or community best practice.

## Example Output Structure

1. **Executive Summary** — Key findings and context
2. **Sources & Methods** — Where/how the research was conducted
3. **Best Practice Patterns** — Enumerated and explained
4. **Recommended Folder Structure** — Tree diagram, with explanations
5. **Customization/Adaptation Guidance** — For different project scenarios
6. **Operational Recommendations** — For maintainability and scaling
7. **References** — Annotated, with links for further reading

## Constraints

- Do not pad with generic software engineering folder advice; focus on Claude/Anthropic/prompt-engineering/LLM context.
- If there is disagreement or ambiguity in sources, note it and suggest a reasoned resolution or options.
- Final output must be directly actionable for new or existing Claude Code/Anthropic project setup.
