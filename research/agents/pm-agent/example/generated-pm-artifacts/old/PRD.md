# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Agent Health Insight System

## Executive Summary

The Multi-Agent Health Insight System is a demonstration/proof of concept that showcases advanced AI orchestration patterns for comprehensive health data analysis. Based on Anthropic's multi-agent research showing 90.2% performance improvements over single agents, this system employs a Chief Medical Officer (CMO) orchestrator that coordinates specialized medical agents to provide deep, multi-perspective health insights.

This is a demonstration system designed to showcase best practices in multi-agent AI coordination, real-time streaming interfaces, and dynamic data visualization. While it handles health data with appropriate security considerations, it is intended as a reference implementation for multi-agent patterns that can be applied across various domains.

## Problem Statement

Healthcare data analysis requires multiple specialized perspectives to provide comprehensive insights. Single AI agents, while powerful, often miss critical correlations between different health domains. Patients and healthcare providers need:

- Comprehensive analysis that considers all aspects of health data
- Real-time visibility into how different specialists analyze their data
- Clear synthesis of multiple expert opinions
- Interactive visualizations to explore health trends
- Confidence in the thoroughness of AI-driven health analysis

Current solutions either provide shallow, single-perspective analysis or require manual coordination of multiple tools, resulting in incomplete insights and missed health patterns.

## Solution Overview

The Multi-Agent Health Insight System implements an orchestrator-worker pattern where:

1. **CMO (Chief Medical Officer) Agent** acts as the orchestrator, assessing query complexity and coordinating specialists
2. **Eight Medical Specialist Agents** provide deep domain expertise:
   - Cardiology (Dr. Heart)
   - Endocrinology (Dr. Hormone)
   - Laboratory Medicine (Dr. Lab)
   - Data Analysis (Dr. Analytics)
   - Preventive Medicine (Dr. Prevention)
   - Pharmacy (Dr. Pharma)
   - Nutrition (Dr. Nutrition)
   - General Practice (Dr. Primary)
3. **Visualization Agent** generates interactive React components for data exploration
4. **Real-time UI** shows agent coordination and progress through SSE streaming

The system categorizes queries into four complexity levels (Simple, Standard, Complex, Critical) and activates appropriate specialists accordingly.
