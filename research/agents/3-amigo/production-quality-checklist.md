## Success Criteria

The implementation meets production standards when:

1. **Feature Parity**: All features from PM specifications are implemented
2. **Visual Polish**: UI matches or exceeds UX prototypes in quality
3. **Error Resilience**: System handles failures gracefully
4. **Performance**: Feels responsive under normal usage
5. **Accessibility**: Usable by people with disabilities
6. **Mobile Ready**: Works well on all device sizes
7. **Professional Feel**: Indistinguishable from manually crafted app

## Common Issues and Solutions

### PM Agent Issues
- **Missing production features** → Use enhanced instructions
- **Vague requirements** → Request specific implementation details

### UX Agent Issues
- **Insufficient components** → Require 25+ component specifications
- **No glassmorphism** → Mark as CRITICAL in instructions
- **Basic prototypes** → Request interactive demos with animations

### Claude Code Issues
- **Wrong technology stack** → Enforce exact dependency versions
- **Missing features** → Use comprehensive CLAUDE.md template
- **Poor UI quality** → Require exact prototype matching

Use this checklist at each stage to ensure the 3 AI Amigos produces applications that match the quality of your manually created target system.
