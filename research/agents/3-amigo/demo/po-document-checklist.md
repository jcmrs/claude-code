- Code artifact streaming pattern
- React component generation

✅ **14. dependency-management-guide.md** → Goes in `requirements/technical-patterns/`
- CRITICAL: Exact versions to prevent conflicts
- Solutions for common dependency issues
- Required for consistent builds

✅ **15. sse-implementation-guide.md** → Goes in `requirements/technical-patterns/`

## Key Points for Demo

1. **Technical docs are reusable** - Same files work for finance, legal, etc.
2. **Domain docs are specific** - Change these for different use cases
3. **New guides prevent common issues** - Dependency versions, SSE patterns
4. **CLAUDE.md includes troubleshooting** - Common issues & solutions
5. **Tools are pre-built** - Already in backend/tools/, don't recreate

## Demo Script Note

"As the Product Owner, I've prepared domain-specific requirements for our health system, visual mockups of what we want to build, along with reusable technical patterns that work for any multi-agent system. Watch how the AI agents take these documents and create a complete, production-ready system..."
