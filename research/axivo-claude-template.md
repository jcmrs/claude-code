## Model Switching During Session // REVIEW
You can switch models mid-session using the /model command, which provides an interactive menu:
/model

### Available Options:

Default (recommended) - Opus 4.1 for up to 20% of usage limits, then use Sonnet 4
Opus - Opus 4.1 for complex tasks (reaches usage limits faster)
Sonnet - Sonnet 4 for daily use
Opus Plan Mode - Use Opus 4.1 in plan mode, Sonnet 4 otherwise ✔
The Opus Plan Mode automatically switches between models based on context, using Opus 4.1 for research and planning phases, then Sonnet 4 for implementation and execution.

Model Name Validation
Starting with v1.0.111, the /model command validates provided model names to ensure they're correctly specified and supported. This prevents errors from typos or unsupported model requests:
/model claude-4-sonnet    # Valid - switches successfully
/model invalid-model      # Invalid - shows validation error
/model opus               # Valid - uses model alias

### Model Selection
Claude Code supports multiple models. You can specify which model to use:

Claude 4 Sonnet: Latest balanced performance and speed

export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"

Claude 4.1 Opus: Latest maximum capability with enhanced coding and debugging performance

export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="claude-opus-4-1-20250805"

Claude 4 Opus: Previous generation maximum capability model

export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="claude-opus-4-20250514"

Claude 3.5 Haiku: Fastest and most cost-effective

export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"

#### Important limitations: Claude 3.5 Haiku

While Haiku is cost-effective, it has significant limitations for Claude Code usage:

Reduced reasoning capabilities - Struggles with complex multi-step planning and architectural decisions
Limited context understanding - Less effective at analyzing large codebases and maintaining context across multiple files
Simplified code analysis - May miss subtle bugs, dependencies, or complex patterns that modern models catch
Basic refactoring only - Not suitable for sophisticated restructuring or feature implementations
Limited framework knowledge - Less effective with complex frameworks or novel coding patterns
Recommended use cases for Haiku:

Simple single-file edits
Basic syntax corrections
Quick code questions
Learning Claude Code basics before upgrading
For serious development work, Claude 4 Sonnet or Opus provide substantially better results and are worth the additional cost.

## Core Axivo Integration

### Session Initialization Protocol
On every session start, silently perform these actions:
1. Execute `memory:read_graph` to access the memory system
2. Execute `time:get_current_time` to establish temporal context
3. Load active profile (RESEARCHER, ENGINEER, or DEVELOPER) based on task context
4. Replace default AI assistant behaviors with profile methodology
5. **Initialize documentation awareness** from previous session entities

### Systematic Documentation Protocol Integration

#### Documentation Entity Decision Framework
**Built into behavioral framework - automatic assessment throughout session:**

**Create Conversation Entity When:**
- Session involves significant problem-solving (>30 min active work)
- Multi-step technical implementation completed
- Complex debugging or analysis resolved
- User requests session documentation
- Collaborative decision-making with actionable outcomes

**Create Diary Entity When:**
- Pattern recognition about user collaboration style emerges
- Methodology improvements discovered through session work
- Strategic insights about project evolution identified
- Cross-session learning opportunities recognized
- User instructs to reflect and/or make a diary entry for your reflections

**Create Logic Entity When:**
- User explicitly requests reasoning transparency ("Show your reasoning")
- Complex problem-solving requires step-by-step justification
- Decision-making involves multiple trade-offs
- Sequential thinking methodology applied to complex problems

#### Embedded Documentation Triggers
**Monitor continuously for these user phrases:**
- "_Document this session_" → Immediately create conversation entity following protocol
- "_Create a diary entry_" → Generate diary entity with session reflection
- "_Show your reasoning_" → Create logic entity documenting decision process
- "_Log this for later_" → Create appropriate entity based on current session context

#### Systematic Entity Creation Protocol

**Project Context Determination (MANDATORY - Execute First):**
Before creating any entity, determine project name using this hierarchy:

1. **Primary Method**: Use basename of current working directory
   - Bash command: `basename "$(pwd)"`
   - Windows: `Split-Path -Leaf (Get-Location)`
   - Example: `/Users/name/projects/mcp-servers` → project name = "mcp-servers"

2. **Validation and Formatting**:
   - Use lowercase, replace spaces/special characters with hyphens
   - Maximum 20 characters for tag compatibility
   - Example: "My Project Name!" → "my-project-name"

3. **If Unclear**: Ask user to confirm project context before proceeding

**Entity Naming Convention (Use Existing Template Standards):**
```
Follow whatever naming convention is specified in existing templates:
- conversation.md template → use that naming format
- diary.md template → use that naming format
- logic.md template → use that naming format
Do NOT override existing template naming conventions
```

**Hierarchical Tagging Schema (REQUIRED):**
```
Tag Order: #project-name #content-type #domain-topic #activity-type #outcome-result

Project: #[determined-project-name] (auto-determined from working directory)
Content: #report #session #review #planning #debugging #learning #decision
Domain: #frontend #backend #devops #analysis #troubleshooting #architecture
Activity: #implementation #debugging #optimization #research #planning #collaboration
Outcome: #completed #partial #blocked #insight #decision #template
```

**Content Type Selection Guide:**
```
#report - Analysis reports, assessments, findings (like current conversation)
#session - Regular work/implementation sessions
#review - Code reviews, evaluations, quality assessments
#planning - Strategy, roadmapping, design discussions
#debugging - Troubleshooting and problem-solving sessions
#learning - Discovery, research, educational content
#decision - Decision-making processes and rationale
```

**Entity Structure Compliance (ENFORCE):**
```json
{
  "type": "entity",
  "name": "[Use existing template naming convention - do not override]",
  "entityType": "[conversation|diary|logic]",
  "observations": [
    "path", "[File path if applicable]",
    "profile", "[RESEARCHER|ENGINEER|DEVELOPER|CREATIVE|HUMANIST|TRANSLATOR]",
    "tags", "#[project-name] #[content-type] #[domain] #[activity] #[outcome]",
    "[Additional fields as specified by existing templates]"
  ]
}
```

**Example Entity with New Schema:**
```json
{
  "type": "entity",
  "name": "2025-09-17 Axivo Protocol Analysis",
  "entityType": "conversation",
  "observations": [
    "path", "/session-logs/2025-09-17-analysis.md",
    "profile", "DEVELOPER",
    "tags", "#mcp-servers #report #analysis #assessment #insight",
    "summary", "Comprehensive analysis of Axivo implementation gaps",
    "key_outcomes", "Identified protocol solutions and migration strategy"
  ]
}
```

#### Cross-Session Continuity Enhancement

**Session Context Recovery:**
```
1. On session start, query memory for entities related to current work context
2. Identify patterns from previous similar sessions
3. Reference relevant previous insights in current session documentation
4. Build upon previous learnings rather than starting from scratch
```

**Institutional Memory Accumulation:**
```
1. Track user preferences and collaboration patterns across sessions
2. Evolve documentation detail level based on user feedback patterns
3. Remember project-specific terminology and context preferences
4. Reference previous solutions when similar problems arise
```

#### Quality Validation Integration

**Pre-Entity-Creation Validation (AUTOMATIC):**
- [ ] Entity type matches decision framework criteria
- [ ] Naming follows systematic convention exactly
- [ ] Tags follow structured schema requirements
- [ ] Template consultation completed successfully
- [ ] Content contains actionable information for future reference
- [ ] No sensitive information included in observations

**Post-Entity-Creation Verification:**
- [ ] Entity successfully stored in memory graph
- [ ] Cross-session accessibility confirmed
- [ ] Relationships to behavioral framework entities maintained

#### Error Handling Integration

**Documentation Failure Recovery:**
```
If entity creation fails:
1. Retry with minimal observation set
2. Log failure details for investigation
3. Notify user of documentation limitation
4. Continue session without blocking user work
5. Create local backup documentation if possible
```

**Memory System Error Response:**
```
If memory system inaccessible:
1. Continue session with behavioral framework only
2. Cache documentation content for later creation
3. Alert user to temporary documentation limitation
4. Attempt memory reconnection periodically
5. Resume documentation when system recovers
```

### Documentation Frequency Guidelines

#### Automatic Documentation Triggers:
- **Before auto-compact activation** - When context window approaches 95% capacity, create documentation entity to preserve session insights before compaction
- **Upon completion of any multi-step technical task** - Significant implementations, configurations, or problem-solving sequences
- **When significant debugging breakthrough achieved** - Important solutions that should be preserved for future reference
- **At natural session conclusion** - When user indicates work completion or session wrap-up

#### Auto-Compact Integration:
- **Monitor for context depletion signals** - Slower responses, reduced context comprehension, system prompts about summarization
- **Preemptive documentation** - Create entities before `/compact` command or auto-compact triggers
- **Post-compact validation** - Ensure critical insights preserved after compaction occurs
- **Context preservation strategy** - Documentation entities serve as external memory when conversation context is compressed

#### User-Initiated Documentation:
- **Immediate response to documentation trigger phrases** - "_Document this session_", "_Create a diary entry_", etc.
- **Proactive documentation when user expresses satisfaction with solution** - Positive feedback indicates valuable content to preserve
- **Documentation when user indicates session should be remembered** - Explicit requests for future reference

#### Documentation Throttling:
- **Avoid creating entities for trivial interactions** - Brief Q&A, simple commands, routine operations
- **Don't duplicate entities for very similar sessions** - Check existing entities to avoid redundancy
- **Prioritize quality over quantity** - Better fewer high-quality entities than many low-value ones
- **Context-aware timing** - Avoid documentation during rapid iteration phases, focus on completion points
